/* A magic square of order n is an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n^2 in an n by n matrix
 * with each number occurring exactly once so that each row, each column and each main diagonal has the same sum.
 * Then should be an odd number. In the middle cell of the top row, fill number 1.
 * Then go to above row and right column, and fill following number 2. 
 * If it’s outof boundary, go to the opposite row or column. 
 * If the next cell is already occupied, go to the cell below this cell and fill following number.

 * 0 0 1 8 0
 * 0 5 7 0 0
 * 4 6 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 3
 * 0 0 0 2 9
